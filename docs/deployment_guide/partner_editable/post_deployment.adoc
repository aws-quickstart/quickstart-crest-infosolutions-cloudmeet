// Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps
The system requires a valid DNS entry that points to the Network Load Balancer's Amazon Resource Name (ARN). The Network Load Balancer must have SSL certificates and Elastic IP addresses.

. Update your DNS by adding two entries, one for each web tier and video-call tier. Take the ARNs of the Network Load Balancers and add the appropriate entry to your DNS server.
. After the DNS propagates, the server is accessible through the domain name you provided in the template.
. Test your login credentials using `jsnow` for both the user name and password. You can change and disable the test user accounts via the identity-management system that's included in the stack.

=== Test the deployment

When the AWS CloudFormation template creates the stack, the Fargate instance runs in your AWS cluster. The {partner-product-short-name} application installs in the Amazon ECS host instances.

==== Evaluation
Verify that the {partner-product-short-name} application is running and accessible:

. In the AWS CloudFormation console, navigate to *Service Stack*, and choose the *Outputs* tab.
. Note the value of the corresponding *Key Attributes*:
```
** KEY Attribute1 - RCHATEVALNLBURL
** KEY Attribute2 - JVBEVALNLBURL
** KEY Attribute3 - CloudmeetDomain
** KEY Attribute4 - CloudcallDomain
```
. Provide the *KEY Attributes* to support@progentys.com. The Progentys support team maps the shared values of these attributes to the provided domain name.
. When Progentys completes the mapping, customers can use a web browser to access the URL (https://cloudmeetdomain/cloudmeet).
. By default, the user name and password are `jsnow`.

==== Production
To verify that the {partner-product-short-name} application is running and accessible, follow this step:

. In the AWS CloudFormation console, choose the *Outputs* tab from *Service Stack*.
. Note the value of the corresponding *KEY Attribute*:
```
** KEY Attribute - CloudmeetDomain
```
. Use a web browser to access the URL (https://cloudmeetdomain/cloudmeet).
. By default, the user name and password are `jsnow`.

==== Security
At startup, only port 22 is open. You can restrict this port by providing an IP address or range of IP addresses for the AdminIngressLocation parameter. If you want to open
these ports to everyone, set the IP address to `0.0.0.0/0`. This is not advised, however, because your instances will be less secure.
