image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets, managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets, AWS Fargate, located in an Auto Scaling group, to provide on-demand, compute capacity for containers. 
* An internet gateway to allow access to the internet.*
* A Network Load Balancer to balance traffic between Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.
* Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) to provide a serverless elastic file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.
* (Optional) Amazon Route 53 to provide hostnames.
* A user-provided certificate stored in AWS Certificate Manager.
* An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that references external environment files.
* Container images, stored in a public Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR).

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
